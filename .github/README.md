> Hello. My name is Miloš. I am from Belgrade, Serbia. I have many interests, of which one is making semi-useless stuff on Github.<br>Stuff I usually make is useful to just me or maybe one-two users that will somehow stumble upon my repositories.<br><br> I love cats. They're my favourite furry friends. I have three cats; two of them being little one's that are almost one-year old that I found abandoned in a bush, named Eva and Freyja and one big old cat named Star.<br><br>I love to watch Anime. My favourite ones are: <i>Owari no Seraph</i>, <i>Mirai Nikki</i> and <i>Neon Genesis: Evangelion</i><br>You can check my [Anilist Profile](https://anilist.co/user/MVukanichh/) to see other stuff that I liked.<br><br>I have extreme fear of heights. Like, really extreme. Sometimes when I get on a chair to get something (Since I am 175cm tall), I get extremely scared of the height, even though it's not big at all!<br><br>I am an Orthodox Christian. MY faith holds a significant meaning in my life and, despite not being as religious as some are, I wouldn't be who I am without my faith.<br><br>I love playing video games. My favourite are: <i>Call of Duty: World at War</i>, <i>Warcraft 3</i>, <i>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series</i>, <i>The Elder Scrolls series</i> and <i>F.E.A.R. series</i>.<br><br>I love playing/watching others play Horror games (My favourite YouTuber is [Nepheron](https://youtube.com/@Nepheron)). I also love creepypastas, movies and everything horror related.
